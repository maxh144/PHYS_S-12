  <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Data Visuialization: Potentiometer </h4>

  <div class = "row">      
      <p class = "desc"> I chose to do some simple data visuialization with p5 and WebUSB for this week. Since it was easiest to just transmit one value, I decided on visuializaing the 0-1023 range of a potentiometer. To make a more useful and easy to understand data visuialization, I decided to stick with 2D. </p>

      <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Part I: Dyanmic Color </h4>

      <p class = "desc"> I started with adding a basic circle on a gray background and altering the color values of that circle to indicate the "speed" of the potentiometer. I switched to thr HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) color mode to be able to control different aspects of color easier than with RGB color. The speed is calculated by subtracting the 2 most recent readings from the potentiometer. This speed is then mapped onto a 0-100 range so the speed can control the saturation of the circle. In testing this, I found that on a gray background, having the circle have the same brightness as the background made it look like the background faded in from being transparent as saturation increased, which made for an interesting effect. Now that I had a way to visuialize speed, I moved on to how to visuialize the position.</p>

      <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;">  Part II: Wiper Position and Arcs </h4>

      <p class = "desc"> At first, I overlayed a static color arc onto the circle. The arc started at 0 and ended at an angle mapped from the potentiometer value. This worked pretty well, but I wanted to make the arc have a rainbow color, so I ditched the <code>arc()</code> function and switched to making individual lines to create a solid arc. Each line ended up being 0.02 radians apart from one another to fill the circle. This way, I could vary the color (hue) of each line to get a rainbow fade radialy, similar to some of p5's color examples. I shifted the start and end points of this line-arc by altering the start of the adding to the angle after the mapping from the potentiometer value. The for loop drawing the arc stops at the wiper, giving the appearence that the wiper reveals a rainbow circle below.</p>

      <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Part III: Combing the two </h4>

      <p class = "desc"> to combine the speed and position visuilizations, I took the main rainbow arc from part II and altered its brightness, so the wheel got brighter the faster the potentiometer was going. I altered the brightness instead of the saturation because I liked the look better for an arc, and to be able to use a colored background. I also set the speed to alter the radius, making the wheel pop out more the faster the values are changing.</p>

      <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Arduino Code</h4>

      <p class = "desc"> The Arduino code is almost identical to the code given out in class, just with a bit of averaging to smooth out the values. I'm most;y drawing attention to this because I was getting some very strange behavior with the averaging function returning very large negative values whenever averaging more than 2 readings. I tried adding all types of delay to combat this, but the only thing that worked was adding a print statement after the loop summing the values. I have no idea why, but I thought it was interesting to note.</p>
