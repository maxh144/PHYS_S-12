  <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> A Long Sequence of Failures </h4>

  <div class = "row">      
      <p class = "desc"> This assignment was by far my least successful. I made a mistake at almost every step, so I want to focus on these in explaining my assignment</p>
  </div>

    <div class = "row">


      <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Casting Object </h4>

      <p class = "desc"> For my casting object, I chose a small figurine I had lying around. This ended up being a bit too big for the amount of silicone we had, creating my first set of problems. The long limbs that curved around and created loops also worried me. I also wasn't sure how I was going to remove the positive from the mold, but I decided to figure that out later </p>
  </div>



  <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;">  Pouring the Silicone </h4>

  <div class = "row">
    <div class = "col-sm-6">

      <p class = "desc"> To start, I made a box out of cardboard and duct tape to pour the silicone in. I attached the figure with some tape to the bottom of the box, creating a pouring hole for the actual casting. Since I had some, I also sprayed some mold release on the object and box, mostly to make sure the more detailed parts like the head actually came out of the mold. I mixed up the silicone (mostly following the instructions) and started to pour, but ran out about halfway through. I then mixed up a second batch of silicone using some from a different brand, and was able to coat about <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of the model. Because I made sure to pour on top of the head towards the end, it ended up having a ~1mm skin, still allowing for some casting. </p>

  <div class = "row">
      <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Removing the Figure </h4>

      <p class = "desc"> To remove the figure from the mold, I had to make a vertical cut splitting the mold into 2. With all of the limbs and the mouth opening, I knew I wouldn't be able to remove the entire figure through the pouring hole. Through seperating the two halfs, I was able to remove the half without the head, but couldn't get the other half. To avoid ripping the thin silicone around the head, I ended up making a slit down it to remove the object. </p> 
  </div>

  <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Casting attempt I: Ice</h4>

  <div class = "row">

    <div class="col-sm-6">

      <p class = "desc"> For my first casting attempt, I used green dyed water. I thought it would be fun to have a ice cube of my cast and was readily avialable. To put the 2 halfs of the mold together, I used rubber bands and tape, and paintbrushes to hold up the mold. I covered somes holes in the thinner silicone areas with grease to make sure no water would leak out. Even with this, some water did start to leak, so I had to top up the mold a couple of times. This cast was going well until I got impatient and tried to remove the cast early. Only the top of the cast was frozen, and the rest of the water leaked out. I was still able to get some detail from the base of the figurine though. Feeling how thin some of the areas of the ice would be, I decided to move to a less britile material. </p>

<h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Casting attempt II: Chocolate</h4>

<div class = "row">

    <div class="col-sm-6">

      <p class = "desc"> For my second attempt, I tried casting in chocolate. When melting the chocolate, I also added some milk to make it melt and flow better. With the chocolate, since it was more viscous, I also had to remove some of the grease to act as a air hole to let air out while pouring. I also put this in the freezer to cool quicker, but it never did. I had added too much milk, giving the chocolate a putty-like texture even when fully cooled. I tried removing the positive, but it fell apart while coming out. Disillusioned with household casting mediums, I moved on to my last resort.  </p>

      <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Casting attempt III: Resin</h4>

      <p class = "desc"> For my final attempt, I tried casting using some resin I had remaining from my final project. Since this resin was advertised as a casting resin, I hoped this would work quite well. I mixed up the resin and then followed similar steps to casting with chocloate, leaving the resin to cure overnight. When I came back in the morning, I found that I hadn't used a 1:1 ratio of the parts for the resin, so it hadn't cured properly (the only time in ~10 casts!) leaving the resin with a sticky and malleable consistency. Working quickly, I was still able to get the object out and I was actually very suprisied with how well it had turned out given all of my failures. The cast still did have some chocolate left over on it, and the bottom jaw and tail were lost, but I was still overall happy with the results. </p>
