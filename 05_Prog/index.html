  <div class = "row">
        <p class = "desc"> For the coding part of this assignment, I wanted to use LEDs to visualize algorithims I had used before to better understand how they work. I chose 2 algorithms: An algorithm that compares all the elements in an array, and a binary counter. To do this, I needed an 1 x 4 array and a button. </p>

  <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Wiring </h4>

  <div class = "row">

    <div class=col-sm-6>
      <p class = "desc"> To keep the circuit compact and to try using a new mircocontroller, I wanted to program these visuializations with the ESP32 Huzzah rather than the Metro. This was similar to working with a Metro, except for the strange pinout and high pin numbers. I used <a href="https://makeabilitylab.github.io/physcomp/esp32/assets/images/AdafruitHuzzah32PinDiagram.png" class="link">this</a> guide to help. I wanted all of the 4 LEDs to be the same color, which meant that I had to use the RGB LEDs from the kit. Using <a href="https://www.circuitbread.com/tutorials/how-rgb-leds-work-and-how-to-control-color" class="link">this</a> guide, I realized that I only needed to wire 2 of the legs if I wanted solid blue LEDs. Since the LEDs in the kit were common cathode, I wired the longest leg to ground. The button is wired with the internal pullup resistors. </p>

      <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Code 1: Array Comparison </h4>

  <div class = "row">

    <div class=col-sm-4>

      <p class = "desc"> This code used a button to switch between 2 common nested for loop uses: a staircase style where j starts as i, and a variation where i is compared to j. I switched between these with a button that acted as a switch, attached to a interrupt. The interrupt is triggered on <code>FALLING</code>, meaning the function is called when the button is pressed. A condition is added into the interrupt function (ISR) so that it can't be executed more than once every 200ms. Download <a href="./cycle.ino" class="link" download>here</a>.</p>

  <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Code 2: Binary Counter</h4>

  <div class = "row">

    <div class=col-sm-4>
      <p class = "desc"> This code has 2 parts. One simply counts the number of times a button has been pressed, with a timer and for stability without missing button presses, and a function that converts a base 10 number to a number in binary. This function is a slightly modified version of one that would output the binray number as a string, changing the state of an LED instead of writing to a string.

  <h4 class= "subhead" style="text-align: center; margin: 100px 0px 25px 0px;"> Installing Arduino IDE Troubleshooting </h4>

  <p class = "desc" style = "text-indent: 0rem;"> To code for this assignment, I wanted to install Arduino IDE on another computer I had. This ended up being a lot more trouble than it was worth. I had problems because Arduino had already been installed on my OneDrive Account, so my computer wouldn't reinstall it, even though I wasn't logged in to my OneDrive Account. I solved this by logging in. To figure this out, I ran Arduino_debug from the console. More info <a href="https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360021218899-Arduino-IDE-won-t-open-Error-occurred-during-initialization-of-VM" class="link">here</a>.</p>
