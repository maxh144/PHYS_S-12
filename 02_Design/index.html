      <h4 class = "subhead"> Fusion 360 </h4>
      <p class="desc">  I have already been using Fusion 360 for a couple of years, so this peice of software wasn't new to me. I use Fusion for making design sketches of projects and prototyping 3D printed parts to connect different aspects of the projects. Fusion's sketch-based approach and timeline feature made it easy for me to learn and kept it versatile to changes in dimensions or design. <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNMdG2-zY2yFhwz8Y-KV2AA_8tllwSBu6" class="link">Here is the tutorial I learned from.</a> Since I have already been using Fusion, I decided to focus on learning 2 areas of Fusion I haven't used much: <b>Model parameters and Constraints</b> </p>

      <h4 class = "subhead"> Parameters and Constraints </h4>
      <p class="desc" style="margin-top:125px;"> Both of these features were easy to understand and pick up, but drastically changed my workflow while sketching. Constraints were helpful as I could just draw the basic shape I needed, then get the proportions, angles, sizes, location of parts correct by constraining them to eachother. I particuarly found the <b>mirror/symmetry, coincident, midpoint, and fix</b> contraints useful to position objects. Since Fusion also automatically makes constraints, I sometimes had to delete useless constraints that were blocking new, helpful constraints from being added.  </p>

      <p class="desc" style="margin-top:100px;"> Parameters were fun to learn, but ended up being less helpful to modeling real-life objects than I expected. As parameters are intended to make a model parametric, or able to be changed, they weren't as useful for static objects that wouldn't be changed as they weren't my own design. I found parameters most useful in the 2 models I made to reference dimensions across multiple places in the timeline, making my work easier to follow. I also started directly using all inputed dimensions as parameters for functions like extrude (As seen <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-design-validate/moving-a-component-from-one-file-to-another-with-its-parameters/td-p/9859699" class="link">here</a>) by typing the name of the dimension in (Ex: d13 for the 13th dimension). I was able to make good use of parameters to make my strip of LEDs have a user-defined amount of LEDs.</p>

  <p style=" font-size: 1.5rem;text-align: center; margin-top: 150px;"> Here are my final models for the assignment. They are both based on extruded sketches that were then combined into one object. </p>
