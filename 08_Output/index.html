        <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> TFT Display </h4>

      <p class = "desc"> Out of the output devices in the kit, I wanted to learn how to use the TFT display the most. I had already used LED strips, and knew that a display could be helpful for my final project. Since I would have a lot of sensors, I needed an easy way to display data from those sensors without carrying around a computer. This is typically done with an OSD (On Screen Display), and a TFT display could serve a similar purpose. </p>

       <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;">  Wiring </h4>

      <p class = "desc">  The wiring for the TFT was similar to the guide provided, except for the SPI pins. Since I was using hardware SPI for speed, the hardware SPI pins are on a 3x2 header on the right side of the Metro instead of digital pins like an UNO. I also wired a button into the ground and another digital pin to give some functionality to the screen that I implemented later. For my sensor to test with, I chose my distance sensor from last week, since I already had it built. I ended up switching the resistor for the phototransistor to 47 KOhm and recalibrating the sensor to be able to see farther.</p>

  <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Objectifying Code</h4>

  <div class = "row">

      <p class = "desc"> To make my use of the TFT scalable and easy for future projects, I wanted to write a TFT wrapper class so that I could input values into an update function, and the class would do the rest. I realized that for this project, I would need 3 classes: one for the screen, one for the button, and one for the IR sensor. I wanted the button to interact with the screen so that when the button was pressed, it would cycle between a view of the 4 sensor values and a closeup for each value. This meant that I needed a cyclic button with multiple states, so I started by writing a class for that and a simple momentary button. I used interrupts to make the cyclic button work, so the state of the button would update automatically and could just be retrieved using a accessor function. I then made one of these buttons private data of the screen and had the screen check its state when it updated to check which mode to be in. The IR sensor got its own class that would interact with the main file, so that the main file would get a distance from the sensor and send it to the screen.</p>

  <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Problems Objectifying Code</h4>


  <div class = "row">
      <p class = "desc"> I had a lot of problems actually writing the code I had planned out, since I had never written OOP code in C++. At first I tried to just write the classes in seperate .ino files, but this didn't want to work due to my composition of a button inside of a screen object. Partially because of this and partially to make my code more reusable, I seperated the classes into their own .h and .cpp files, making them function like a library. <a class="link" href="https://roboticsbackend.com/arduino-object-oriented-programming-oop/#Reorganize_your_Arduino_OOP_code">This tutorial</a> was my main guide in this endeavor. Researching the point and style of header files before starting coding would have been extremely helpful, breifely explained <a class="link" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3746484/why-am-i-getting-this-redefinition-of-class-error"> here </a>. I also found <a class="link" href="https://forum.arduino.cc/t/interrupt-inside-a-class/180419/6">this</a> extremly helpful in having an interrupt inside a class. I couldn't get object instantiation for the button and Adafruit GFX to work inside any function of the classes, so I had to do it when the variables were defined. Because the objects were setup outside any function, I needed to use <code>#DEFINE</code> to declare pins. <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/t/text-overwrite-on-tft-touch-screen-applicatio/350948" class="link">This thread</a> was also helpful in understanding how to clear parts of the TFT screen. I also added a simple watchdog timer to the TFT display so it didn't update too quickly, all handled behind the scenes by the class.</p>

      <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;">Final Result</h4>


      <p class = "desc"> The result of all this time and frustration on OOP code is a clean and simple main .ino file. All it has to do is instantiate and call the <code>init()</code> and <code>update()</code> functions to make the display work. It feeds values from the sensor to display using <code> getDist() </code> and sets the rest of the values to a random double. <a class="link" href="./Code.zip" download> Code </a></p>
