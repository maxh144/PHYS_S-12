  <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Goal </h4>

  <div class = "row">      
      <p class = "desc"> For this assignment, I wanted to focus on a goal that I needed for my final project rather than using one specific technology: Getting a livestream of video from the ESP-32 CAM and sensor data values in a website, with enough range to work for a RC craft. I also didn;t want this to rely on Wifi, as this would limit my mobility.  </p>
  </div>

    <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;">  Camera Example </h4>

    <div class = "row">

    <div class=col-sm-6>

      <p class = "desc"> I wanted to test the camera capabilities of the ESP CAM, so I loaded up the camera example from the IDE (Guide <a class="link" href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-video-streaming-face-recognition-arduino-ide/ "> here </a>). This example starts up similar to how a program using the ESP as local server would, printing a local IP. This IP contains a full website with HTML, CSS, and JS. Since all the code was in Arduino, this confused me immensly. I decided to leave the example behind for now.</p>

  <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;">  ESP-NOW </h4>

  <div class = "row">
      <p class = "desc"> First, I tried using ESP-NOW. This felt like the obvious choice, since it worked off radio, which is fast and long-range. I followed the <a class="link" href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp-now-esp32-arduino-ide/">ESP-NOW tutorial</a> from RandomNerd, and this also was the end of my tests with ESP-NOW. I found out from this tutorial that the maximum package size of ESP-NOW is 250 bytes, which is nowhere near enough to livestream video. After doing a bit more research to see if this limit could be overcome, I decided to abandon ESP-NOW.</p>

      <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> VTX Transmitter</h4>

      <p class = "desc"> From former RC projects, I had a VTX transmitter lying around, so I wondered if I could use that. The transmitter takes in a video line and sends the video to a reciever connected to a headest. I did some research to see if I could get the ESP-CAM to output a video feed that the transmitter could use as an output, but had no luck. All code surrounding the camera on the ESP-CAM was very unintuitive. All code on the internet was based around the example found in the IDE, making it impossible to isolate a video feed.</p>

  <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;"> Modifing the example</h4>


  <div class = "row">


    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <p class = "desc"> Realizing that the only video feed I had was from the example, I switched course to modifing the example to fit my needs. First, I switched the ESP CAM from using a local WiFi network to being its own access point <a class="link" href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-access-point-ap-web-server/">here</a>. I had seen this around the internet as a solution for DIY smart home devices that wouldn't have internet connectivity, and it reportedly had enough range (~300m). Next, I wanted to see if it was possible to modify the deault HTML of the example, and I found <a class="link" href="https://robotzero.one/esp32-cam-custom-html/"> this</a>. This showed that one of the files in the example, <code>camera_index.h</code>, which was only an massive array of HEX values, was actually a hexidecimal representation of the code of the website. To better understand this code, I spent some time playing around with the website in Inspect mode in Chrome. While I was doing this, I found something very interesting in the live video feed: the feed was just an <code>&ltimg&gt</code> tag, with a source of another local IP. This IP took my to a blank webpage with only the video feed. I made my own template website with this image tag, and it gave me the live feed. This meant that I could make my own website to serve my own needs.</p>

  <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;">Transmitting Sensor Data</h4>

  <div class = "row">
    <div class="col-sm-6">


      <p class = "desc"> I also needed a way to transmit sensor data. Since I was already using Wifi for the video feed, I first found some tutorials using Wifi to transmit data. I couldn't get any of these to work because of the interfering Wifi code for the camera to work. I went back into the .cpp file of the example to see how the Wifi is set up, and found something very interesting. The <code>startCameraServer</code> function had blocks of code that set up extensions and used HTTP GETs. Since there was one of these for the index page, it looked like each one was a seperate webpage. I tried going to the status one, and was met with some JSON text containing data about the status of the camera. I copied this code and modifed it to create my own JSON for sensor information, /sensor. To let this JSON get sensor data, I put a function in the main .ino file to return a value, and then put in a prototype for this function at the top of the.cpp file. While changing the .cpp file, I also removed the ability for the default website to control quality like resolution and brightness, and set them myself at the start of the code in a setup function, using <a class="link" href="https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-ov2640-camera-settings/"> this </a> info.</p>

      <h4 class = "subhead" style = "margin-bottom: 25px;">Recieving Sensor Data</h4>


      <p class = "desc"> Now that I had my ESP CAM outputting the sensor data to a website, I just needed some JS code to take this JSON and harvest data from it, similar to how it would with an API. Since I don't really know any JS, I just started trying diffrent methods I found, mostly following the Mozilla Web Docs. I ended up using Fetch, as it was easiest to get working, following <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch" class="link">this</a>,  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Fetching_data" class="link">this</a>, and  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON" class="link">this</a> tutorial. I also found  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON" class="link">this</a> helpful in getting the text into JSON so I could parse it. By then putting all of this code inside a function and setting up that function to repeat using  <a href="https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/javascript/js+repeat+function+every+x+seconds" class="link">setInterval()</a>, I was left with a working website to retrieve my data.</p>

  let url = 'http://192.168.4.1/sensor';
      
      function updateVals(){
      fetch(url).then(function(response) {
          response.json().then(function(data) {
              document.getElementById('depth').innerHTML = 
                "Value: " + data['framesize'];
          });
      });
  }

  setInterval(updateVals, 500);
